I'm Mark - a professional product developer with a background in streamed data, machine learning, web applications and enterprise web application security.  I'm also interested in lots of other things, and wanted a plce to collect projects and thoughts and try stuff out.

This site is built using the [Type on Strap theme](https://github.io/sylhare/Type-on-Strap), so thanks to them!
